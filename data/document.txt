He awoke to the sound of the clock ticking in a room that seemed endlessly vast and yet suffocatingly small at the same time.
A letter appeared on the desk, bearing no sender, and its words seemed to twist and coil in his mind as he read them.
The hallways stretched on infinitely, bending back upon themselves so that every door led only to another identical corridor.
Time seemed to thicken, pressing down on him, as moments repeated with subtle differences that made reality feel uncertain.
He reached for the staircase, only to find it led sideways into a gallery of portraits whose eyes followed him with silent accusation.
The office was filled with the scent of damp paper and the murmurs of clerks who moved mechanically as if part of a larger, unknowable machine.
Outside, the city unfolded in impossible angles, streets folding in on themselves, and familiar landmarks vanished the moment he approached.
A conversation began without words, gestures taking the place of language, yet each motion carried the weight of unspoken dread.
Shadows crawled along the walls in ways that defied geometry, drawing him forward into a maze from which there seemed no escape.
Each attempt to assert his identity failed, as if the very act of naming himself was being denied by the world around him.
The door opened to reveal a room lit by a dim, flickering light, filled with objects he had never seen but somehow recognized.
He tried to leave but found the exit had shifted, replaced by a mirror that reflected not his image but a stranger's face.
The letters on the page danced and rearranged themselves, making him question whether he had ever truly written them at all.
A knock at the window revealed no one, yet the echo of the sound seemed to resonate within the walls of his mind.
He wandered through the empty streets, feeling simultaneously invisible and observed, as if existence itself were a contradiction.
The rain fell in slow, deliberate patterns, soaking everything yet leaving him untouched, as though he were part of a dream.
Voices whispered from unseen corners, carrying messages he could almost comprehend but never fully grasp.
He opened a drawer to find it empty, yet the act of opening it filled him with a sense of expectation and despair.
The walls seemed to breathe, expanding and contracting with the rhythm of his own heartbeat.
Every step he took echoed unnaturally, bouncing back with a delay that made the space feel both immense and confining.
He found a key on the floor, rusted and heavy, though he could not remember ever seeing a lock that it might fit.
A candle burned with a flame that flickered in impossible colors, casting shadows that moved independently of their objects.
He sat down to write, but the pen resisted his hand, as if the thoughts themselves refused to be captured on paper.
The clock hands moved backward for a moment, and he felt a shiver of recognition as if he had lived that instant before.
Outside the window, the sky was an unnatural shade of green, and the streets were silent except for a distant hum.
He entered a room he did not remember constructing, filled with furniture that seemed familiar yet wrong.
A letter slid under the door, carrying instructions that made sense only in a logic he could not follow.
He turned the page of the book, only to find it blank, and yet a story lingered in his mind as if written there invisibly.
The mirror reflected a corridor that did not exist behind him, leading to rooms he had never seen.
He reached for the doorknob, but it dissolved under his fingers, leaving only a cold emptiness.
The air was thick with the scent of ink and old paper, suffocating yet strangely comforting.
Footsteps echoed above him, though the floor above was empty and had been for years.
He tried to speak, but the words twisted and fractured before leaving his mouth.
